# dayspan-vuetify-4drupal

> Dayspan Vuetify is a collection of components for Schedules and Calendars in DaySpan using Vuetify. This library is a modified version of Daspan Vuetify to be used by the Drupal Dayspanvuetify module.

Welcome
A lot of modifications are being made to the original dayspan-vuetify in order for it to connect with Drupal and work with nodes and other Entities and with views to create customizable displays of calendars.
